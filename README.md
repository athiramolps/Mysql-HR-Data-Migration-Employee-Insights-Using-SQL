# Mysql-HR-Data-Migration-Employee-Insights-Using-SQL

This project simulates a real-world scenario where a small UK-based startup transitions from traditional spreadsheet-based HR records to a structured relational database system using MySQL. As a junior BI professional, I took on the role of building and populating the database, performing data manipulation tasks, and conducting business analysis to derive HR insights. This beginner-friendly SQL project showcases practical data skills applied in a real-life context.
